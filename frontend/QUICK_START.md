## 🎯 Next Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Indexes (REQUIRED)

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**
```bash
# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Navigate to frontend
cd "C:\Users\Nisha Shetty\Downloads\The Arc\frontend"

# Set project
firebase use --add
# Select: the-arc-dcfee
# Alias: default

# Deploy indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

**Option B: Manual (If automatic fails)**
- Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Go to Firestore → Indexes tab
- Follow instructions in `FIRESTORE_INDEX_DEPLOYMENT.md`

⚠️ **Important:** Indexes take 5-10 minutes to build. Wait before testing!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "The query requires an index" Error
**Solution:** 
1. Copy the URL from the error
2. Click it to create index automatically
3. Wait 5-10 minutes
4. Refresh page

### Images Not Uploading
**Check:**
- Cloudinary credentials in `.env`
- File size < 10MB
- File type is JPEG/PNG/WebP/GIF
- Browser console for errors

### Messages Not Sending
**Check:**
- Users are connected (accepted request)
- Firestore indexes deployed
- Browser console for errors
- Network tab for failed requests

### Videos Not Loading in Browse
**Check:**
- Videos exist in Firestore `videos` collection
- Cloudinary public IDs are correct
- Firestore index for videos is enabled
- User is not viewing their own videos

---

## 📈 Performance Tips

### Optimize Cloudinary:
```javascript
// Use transformations for images
getAvatarUrl(publicId, 200) // 200px circular avatar
getOptimizedImageUrl(publicId, { width: 400, quality: 'auto' })
```

### Firestore Best Practices:
- Use `limit()` in queries (already implemented)
- Unsubscribe from listeners on unmount (already implemented)
- Use pagination for large lists (Browse page could use this)

## 🔐 Environment Variables & Secrets

This project uses environment variables for sensitive configuration (for example, Cloudinary keys). For local development, put your variables in a `.env.local` file at the project root (`frontend/.env.local`).

- Never commit `.env.local` to source control. The repository `.gitignore` already excludes `.env.local`.
- For production, inject secrets via your hosting/CI provider (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Actions, Firebase hosting, etc.) and never store secrets in the repo.

Example (already added locally for you):

```
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset
```

Vite will expose environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` to the client. Treat these values as sensitive and rotate them if they are ever exposed.
